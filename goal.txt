My goal was to make a game that is inspired by Agar.io's private instant merging servers. I partially completed it by making the ball move, grow, and able to eat
food cells. Future goals I would have for the game would be to expand the size of the game, add nicer visuals, make food not spawn inside of the player, create
AI enemy players, and make the ball able to reduce in size over time. A far fetched futuristic goal would include networking and making it multiplayer.
